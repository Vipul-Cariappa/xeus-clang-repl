Using xeus-clang-repl
---------------------

- Rapid Iteration:
  With xeus-clang-repl, you can write and execute C++ code interactively, seeing 
  the results immediately. This REPL nature allows you to iterate quickly without 
  the overhead of compiling and running separate C++ programs.

- Python-C++ Binding:
  To achieve C++ and Python integration within a Jupyter environment, we can use 
  xeus-clang-repl. Thereby, you can write and execute C++ code interactively in this
  environment.

- Magic Commands:
  Jupyter notebooks support magic commands (%%python) and inline code execution 
  for different languages. We use these features to run Python and C++ code in 
  separate cells to achieve interactive communication between them.

- Learning and Teaching:
  C++ enthusiasts can use it to explain and experiment with C++ concepts in a live,
  interactive manner. Students can follow along and test code snippets in real-time,
  improving their understanding of C++. This also applies to C++ workshops and 
  coding boot camps.

- Exploring C++ Libraries:
  You can explore the vast set of C++ libraries and frameworks without having to
  create a complete project. This allows you to quickly assess whether a library
  suits your needs by experimenting with its functions and classes.

- Collaborative Coding:
  Xeus-clang-repl can act as a shared environment where team members can experiment,
  debug, and discuss code in real-time.

- Debugging and Testing:
  You can isolate problematic code segments, experiment with multiple inputs, and
  interactively walk through your code to identify and fix the issues.
