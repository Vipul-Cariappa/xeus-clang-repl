-   **What is Xeus-Clang-REPL?**
    Xeus-Clang-REPL is an interactive programming environment that allows you to 
    execute C++ code in a Jupyter Notebook using the Clang-REPL interpreter.
    
    - Xeus: Xeus is part of the Jupyter ecosystem, which is known for creating 
      interactive notebooks that can include code, visualizations, and narrative text.
    - Clang: Clang is a C/C++ compiler front-end that is part of the LLVM project.
      It's known for its fast compilation times and high-quality diagnostics.
    - REPL: REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It's an interactive programming
      environment.

-   **How do I install and build from source the Xeus-Clang-REPL?**
    Installation instructions can typically be found in the project's documentation.
    You can follow the guide here: :doc:`Installation and usage <InstallationAndUsage>`

-   **What are the benefits of using Xeus-Clang-REPL?**
    You can interactively run and debug C++ code in a Jupyter notebook.
    You can use xeus-clang-repl to prototype C++ code quickly and easily.
    - Rapid Prototyping: Quickly prototype and experiment with C++ code without
      the need to create a full project or compile an entire codebase. 
    - Immediate Feedback: As a REPL, Xeus-Clang provides instant feedback as you
      write and execute code. This helps catch errors early.
    - Interactive Learning: Xeus-Clang-REPL allows learners to interactively
      explore C++ concepts and practice coding in a controlled environment.
    - Debugging: By isolating and testing specific pieces of code, you can more
      easily identify and fix issues in small code snippets.


-   **How do I create a new session?**
    To create a new Xeus-Clang-REPL session, you simply open Jupyter Notebook,
    select the appropriate kernel, and create a new notebook file.

-   **Where can I find documentation and examples for Xeus-Clang-REPL?**
    Documentation, tutorials, and references can other directories of current 
    documentation, i.e :doc:`Documentation <DevelopersDocumentation>`.

-   **How do I contribute to the project?**
